# auth_task — README

## High-level summary
Primary goals: make the project easier to run, verify, and maintain (docs, tests, CI), harden basic security, and add lightweight developer ergonomics (linting, pre-commit, Docker). Each item includes a short description, concrete steps, and an estimated time budget. The times sum to 240 minutes (4 hours).

## If I had more than 4 hours (next priorities)
- Add integration tests and end-to-end scenarios (auth flows, DB migrations).
- Add automated DB migrations and a rollback strategy.
- Add stricter SAST/Supply-chain checks and secret scanning in CI.
- Introduce feature flagging and rate-limiting if this is an API.
- Performance profiling pass (identify hotspots, benchmark suspicious code paths).
- Add example deployments (Helm chart / simple cloud template) and monitoring dashboards.

## Gotchas and things to watch for
- Tests that depend on external services should use mocks or test containers to avoid flakiness.
- Don’t log secrets — ensure logs and CI job outputs redact environment variables.
- Tightening dependency versions can introduce regressions; prefer patch updates in a short window.
- Docker images should be multi-stage and small to reduce build and deploy time.

## Concrete next actions you can ask me to perform now
- Draft a `README.md` with project-specific content (I can generate a template).
- Create unit tests for a specific module (point me at the active source file).
- Scaffold a GitHub Actions workflow, Dockerfile, or pre-commit configuration.

If you tell me which language/framework and the key source files, I’ll produce concrete files and commands within the 4-hour plan.
